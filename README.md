​
## Overview
​
### The challenge

Using ORM to design the back end for an e-commerce brand.
​
### User Story
​
We are using sequelize to to connect with a mySQL database through the express.js API.
​
### Acceptance Criteria
-needs to be tested through insomnia
-use express JS
-use my sequelize


## My process
This was a very repetitive and methodical assignment.
After creating the models, I completed the routes and then tested each model through insomnia.
​
### Built with
​
- Express
- my SQL
​

​
### What I learned
​
This challenge helped me understand the functionality of how models and api routes worked. Testing them in Insomnia using CRUD operations really helped me understand using CRUD operations in back end development.
### Continued development
​
One continued development that I would like to consider is to try building the back end for a store or field that I am very interested in.
​

### Useful resources
​
Insomnia to test
